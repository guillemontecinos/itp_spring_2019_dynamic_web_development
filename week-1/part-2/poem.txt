You’re & Your
You’re & Your walk into a bar.
Bartender says, “Hey, identical twins!”
Your says “Close, but no cigar.”
You’re can’t help but grin.
“See, he has an apostrophe between his ‘u’ & ‘r,’ – also, he’s got an ‘e’
Bartender says, “I don’t see it, but before you drink that beer I need ID”
Your and You’re share a glance, chug their glasses and start to flee
“Hey, c’mon, get back here you too.” the Bartender tries to plea
Bartender goes to call the cops, as he yells “Your not getting away!”
But he could never predict what would happen to him that day.
The authorities arrived, but it was the bartender they’d come to seize,
Your & You’re had told on him first, they’d called the Grammar Police.
